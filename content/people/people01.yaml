# This is an initial example set of individuals, eclectically populated 
# from among public personalities (mostly authors) & collaborators 
# the Animist/Plasma project, toward initial illustrations of entanglement
# (mostly toward experimenting in library deployment contexts and in 
#  collaborations on the Animist project).

# Clearly, one would not "exhaustively" list most spaces of people or other entities in such way.
# But, if one were wishing to support mixed human & computational engagement with different 
# import/export subsets, toward certain aspirational "critical masses" of interesting relationships,
# expressing in this way has a different kind of legibility & manipulability than (e.g.) in a Sqlite database
# (of which I'm very fond), in XML, etc.
